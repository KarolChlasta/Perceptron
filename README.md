# Perceptron
My Python implementation, and simulation of:
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 4 inputs (warm up)
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 10 inputs (Task 1)
- Perceptron, five McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 5 inputs each (Task 2)

Requirements for each task are described in the relevant .jpg files.
