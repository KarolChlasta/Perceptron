# Perceptron
My Python implementation, and simulation of:
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 4 inputs (warm up exercise)
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 10 inputs (Task 1)
- Perceptron, five McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 5 inputs each (Task 2)
- Multilayer perceptron, five McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 5 inputs, each feeding into 3 neurons in 2nd layer (Task 3)

Requirements for each task are described in the relevant Task 1/2/3 jpg files.
The files can be found in the main folder.

Each task is coded in a separate Jupyter notebook:
- Task1-Neuron.ipynb
- Task2-Perceptron.ipynb
- Task3-Multi_Layer_Perceptron.ipynb
