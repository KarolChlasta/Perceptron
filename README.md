# Perceptron
My Python implementation, and simulation of:
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 4 inputs (warm up)
- A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron with 10 inputs (Task 1)
- Perceptron, five McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 5 inputs each (Task 2)
- Multilayer perceptron, five McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 5 inputs, each feeding into 3 neurons in 2nd layer (Task 3)

Each task is coded in separate Jupyter notebook:
- Task1-Neuron.ipynb
- Task2-Perceptron.ipynb
- Task3-Multi_Layer_Perceptron.ipynb

Requirements for each task are described in the relevant .jpg files in the main folder.
